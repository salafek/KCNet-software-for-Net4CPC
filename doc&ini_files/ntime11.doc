	Description

NTIME.COM was implemented on basis of RFC 4330, which describes the Simple
Network Time Protocol Version 4 (SNTPv4). SNTP is a subset of the Network Time
Protocol (NTP) used to synchronize computer clocks. SNTP allow operation in a
simple, stateless remote-procedure call (RPC) mode with accuracy and reliability
expectations similar to the UDP/TIME protocol described in RFC 868.

The program requests the UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) time from a passed
NTP-Server address, normalizes the UTC to CP/M time and converts it to the date
and time of a local time zone.

This local date and time is used to set the system clock of the following 
CP/M-Systems automatically:

- system time of KC85 MicroDOS systems (date is not managed)
- date and time of ZSDOS/ZDDOS systems with BDOS function 99
- date and time of CP/M Plus systems with BDOS function 104 (not tested)

On other systems, the date and time are only displayed on the screen.


	Usage
		
ntime [-h|v] [-fr] [+|-h] [+|-m] [NTP-Server ...]

Parameter:

	-h|v	- Show help or version and exit
	-f	- Full Output
	-r	- Random sequence of NTP-Server addresses

      +|-h	- Time zone offset in hours to UTC (decimal)
      +|-m	- Daylight Savings time offset in minutes (decimal)
NTP-server	- up to 4 NTP server name(s) or IP-address(es)


	Instructions

NTIME.COM comes pre-configured for MET (Middle European Time), respectively CET
(Central European Time). The program contains already 4 NTP server addresses
from de.pool.ntp.org as presets. All preferences can be overwritten with
command-line parameters:

- use +|-h to select another time zone
- use +|-m to take Daylight Savings Time (DST) into account
- use other NTP server addresses in your LAN or in the Internet

Attention: one ore more external address(es), turn off ALL internal addresses !

The option -f gives detailed information about request and reply, the NTP server
data and time calculation. Option -r activates the random selection of internal
or external passed NTP server addresses, when the program starts or a request
have to be repeated to another server.

If NTP server addresses are specified in the internet, the KCNet Interface
settings of the Gateway and DNS-Server must be valid and Internet access be
granted.

Here are some examples of the use of NTIME.COM:

NTIME

	KCNet in Germany, NTP internet server, currently MET 
	(Middle European Time)


NTIME +60

	KCNet in Germany, NTP internet server, currently MEST 
	(Middle European Summer Time)


NTIME +0 +60 0.uk.pool.ntp.org 1.uk.pool.ntp.org 2.uk.pool.ntp.org

	KCNet in United Kingdom, NTP internet server, currently BST
	(British Summer Time)


NTIME +3 192.168.0.1

	KCNet in Moscow, NTP LAN server (192.168.0.1), currently MSK
	(Moscow Standard Time)
	
According to the first two examples, NTIME does not take into account an active
Daylight Savings time. During DST the corresponding offset has to be supplied in
the command-line.

It is easy, to customize the presets for Time Zone, DST and NTP server
addresses. Edit the strings, respectively numbers in the source file NTIMExx.MAC
at the following labels and translate the program again. If your Time Zone
offset isn't in full hours, customize the program in this way.

Time zone:

T_ZSGN:	DB	'+'		;time offset sign
T_ZOFS:	DB	0,0,00EH,010H	;time offset = 3600s (32Bit Net-Order)

Daylight Savings Time:

T_DSGN:	DB	'+'		;Daylight Savings time offset sign
T_DOFS:	DB	0,0,0,0		;Daylight Savings time offset = 0s
				;(32Bit Net-Order)

NTP server addresses (zero terminated strings):

NTP1:	DB	'0.de.pool.ntp.org',0
NTP2:	DB	'1.de.pool.ntp.org',0
NTP3:	DB	'2.de.pool.ntp.org',0
NTP4:	DB	'3.de.pool.ntp.org',0
