	Description

NCFG.COM is the configuration utility for the network configuration of a "KCNet"
Interface for CP/M systems from version 2.x and higher. The program offers the
following possibilities:
	
- view the current network configuration
- apply predefined configurations from the file NCFG.INI
- do automatically network configuration via DHCP or APIPA
- do manually network configuration with passed parameters
- reset the network interface in power-on state 


	Usage
		
ncfg [[DIR|DU:]config name] [-h|v] [-rfq] [-a:hostname]
  [-i:ip-address -m:subnet-mask] [-g:Gateway] [-d:DNS-server]

Parameter:

config name    - config name predefined in [DIR|DU:]NCFG.INI

-h|v           - show help or version and exit

-r             - reset network configuration
-f             - full output
-q             - quiet output

-a:hostname    - auto configuration with DHCP or APIPA
-i:ip-address  - ip-address manually dec. (d.d.d.d)
-m:subnet-mask - subnet-mask manually dec. (d.d.d.d)
-g:Gateway     - network Gateway manually dec. (d.d.d.d)
-d:DNS-server  - DNS-server manually dec. (d.d.d.d)


	Instructions

Start the utility without options to show the current network configuration.

Call it with '-' options in arbitrary order and combination:

- to show the help or version of the program with options '-h' or '-v'
- to reset the complete network configuration with option '-r'
- to configure the interface automatically with option '-a:hostname'
- to configure the interface manually with options '-i' and '-m'

If the '-a'-Option is used, a 'hostname' for possibly registration with a
local DNS-Server in your network is required. With the '-a' option NCFG.COM
configures the network-settings with the help of the DHCP-Server. If no 
DHCP-Server gives an answer, the program configures the network with "APIPA"
in the network 169.254.x.x with subnetmask 255.255.0.0.

The 'hostname' becomes your local DNS-Computername, if there is a working 
DNS-Server in the local network, which takes over the hostnames from the
DHCP-server leases. There are the following restrictions for a 'hostname':

- only characters 'A-Z' (uppercase or lowercase), '0-9', '-' and '.' are
  allowed
- the '.' serves only as separator between labels of a domainname
- the '-' is not allowed to be the first or last character of a label
- the maximum length of a label is 63 and of the whole domainname 255
  characters

If you want configure the TCPIP-Stack manually use the options '-i' and '-m',
these both options have to be used together!

The options '-g' or '-d' can be used alone. In order to reach network 
addresses outside the local network, the Gateway of the network (Router)
must be declared.

If you configure the network manually, the Gateway address is taken over for
the DNS-server automatically, then can be left out the option '-d'.

In order to make life easier, you can predefine any combination of the '-'
options under an arbitrary unique name in the file NCFG.INI and start the
program with that name as a parameter. See examples in the supplied sample file.

It is also possible, to combine all these variants, such as options and one or
more names, in the command line.

If the program is used with NZCOM, instead of the DU: also a named directory can
be passed.
