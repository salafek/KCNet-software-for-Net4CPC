	Description

Wake-On-LAN allows a computer to be turned on or woken up by a network message
platform-independent. The functional basis is the "Magic Packet Technology White
Paper - Copyright 1998 by AMD".

The program forms a so-called "Magic packet" with help of the targets computer
MAC-address and sends an UDP-message to the Directed Broadcast Address of the
local, respectively external network with destination-port 9 ("discard").

If the target computer is able to recognize this WOL-packet, it should turn on
and boot up.


	Usage
		
wol [-h|v] [-f] [[DIR|DU:]name]|[destination-MAC [network/mask]]

Parameter:

   -h|v - Show help or version and exit
     -f - Full Output

   name - Destination name defined in [DIR|DU:]WOL.INI
    MAC - ":"-delimited destination MAC address (hex.)
network	- Network address, if MAC is not in local net (d.d.d.d)
   mask - Subnet mask of the other network (d.d.d.d)


	Instructions

There are 3 possibilities to use the program in principle:

1. Call the program and hand over the MAC-address of the target computer in the
   command-line and optional its external network-address with subnet-mask, if
   it is no participant of the local network.

2. Call the program and hand over the computer name of the target computer in
   the command-line. The necessary parameters of the computer have to be defined
   in the file WOL.INI, see below. If the program can't find the name or correct
   data, it continues automatically to the third variation.

3. Call the program without parameter and select the target computer from the
   presented account list. The listed accounts have to be defined in the file
   WOL.INI, see below.

All MAC-addresses and local/external network addresses are normally not visible,
use option -f for complete output of all parameters.

	WOL.INI:

Target computer data can be defined in the text file WOL.INI, which must be
placed in the same DU: as WOL.COM. If the program is used with NZCOM, instead of
DU: also a named directory can be passed.

In this file, an [Account] must be positioned for each computer, which contains
the following example data:

[Account]				- mandatory
name=PC-WORK				- mandatory
mac=00:60:97:01:02:03			- mandatory
net=192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0		- optional

There are the following restrictions:

	common:

- ";"- and SPC-lines are ignored, data lines begin in the first column
- a data record begins with the keyword [Account]
- parameter and value are separated by an equal sign
- a data line contains no spaces or control-characters before or between data
  characters

	for a 'name':

- only characters 'A-Z' (upper- or lowercase), '0-9' and '-' are allowed
- the '-' should not be the first or last character of a name
- the maximum length of a name is 15 characters

	for a 'mac':

- only hexadecimal characters are allowed, separated by a ":"

	for a 'net':

- only decimal digits are allowed
- the network-address (or IP address) and subnet-mask must be defined in
  dotted decimal format and separated by one slash

The number of accounts is not limited. The program shows the account list page
by page with 9 accounts per side on the screen. The order of the accounts is the
order in the file from top to bottom.

In order to reach a target computer outside the local network, the net of this
computer must be declared and the router(s) must be configured to route directed
broadcasts to other networks.
