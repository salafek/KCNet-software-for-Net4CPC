	Description

With this program you can send print data over a TCP/IP network to a so called
print server from the CP/M commandline. You can think of a print server as a
network card for a printer with additional functionality.

It uses the proprietary JetDirect printing protocol also known as direct socket
printing. This protocol was introduced by Hewlett-Packard 1991 with their
internal print servers installed in HP printers that have a compatible
input/output slot.

The Print-Client can connect with JetDirect Print Servers on any port number
between 1 and 65535 and send raw print data from files and optional printer
codes from the commandline. 


	Network protocol

The program has been implemented on top of the Internet Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP or Stream). In common with other Internet protocols, it passes 8
bit bytes of data.

HP JetDirect is the most simple protocol for network printing. The printer 
server listens on port 9100 usually.
To send a document, the client connects to the server on port 9100 and sends
the raw document data - in a language the printer understands, i.e. ESC/P2 or
PCL/PS!
There is no queue management, so you can’t abort jobs, query the status of
printer/ink/toner or anything like that.


	Usage

nprint [-h|v]|[-rg] server[:port] [<code> ...]|[[DIR|DU:]FN.FT ...]

 Options:   -h|v - show help or version and exit
 
              -r - reset bit 7 of printer file data
              -g - german conversion of printer file data
	      
          server - Print-Server name or IP-address
            port - RAW-TCP port (standard: 9100)
	    
    Data:          in any number and sequence
    
           FN.FT - printer file(s)
	   
          <code> - printer code(s)
                    control char: e.g. ESC (see code list below)
                      ASCII char: ! to ` (33 ... 96)
                                  { to ~ (123 ... 126)
                    decimal code: 2 or 3 digits (00 ... 255)

If you use NZCOM, it is allowed to use named directories instead of the usual
drive/user specification of CP/M.

The order of the options is not arbitrary. First the desired "-" parameters and
then the server and optional port have to be specified, followed by any print
data.


	File data

As the name suggests, the program can send print data from a file to the print
server. Such a file can be printed with wordstar by redirecting the printer
output to a file. You need a proper printer installation of wordstar for the
networked printer. During printing to a file the dot commands of wordstar are
converted to the printer codes of the installed printer, i.e. ESC/P2.

The print files of wordstar use the eighth bit of a character code for internal
purposes. Because CP/M (upto version 2.x) and old printers use only 7 bit for
character encoding, this wasn't a problem during this time.
Modern printers do normally support 8 bit character sets only. If wordstar sets
the eighth bit of sign code internally, a modern printer prints a false sign
from its 8 bit character set.

Formerly the support of national symbols was implemented with the help of
national variants of ISO/IEC 646 with 7 bit character encoding.
Modern printers do no more support such character sets. The old national
character code of ISO/IEC 646 has to be converted to the 8 bit character code
of the supported character set of a modern printer. Mostly code page 437 is
supported, used by IBM PC and MS-DOS, also known as US DOS or OEM-US.

The print client can solve both of the above problems by using the following
options.

	Option -r (reset bit 7 of printer file data)

With this option the Print-Client reads a byte from a given print file and sets
bit 7 to 0 before sending the byte to the print server.
This allows the correct character output of wordstar text files on modern
printers with 8 bit IBM-PC OEM charset.

	Option -g (german conversion of printer file data)

With the help of this option the Print-Client reads a byte from a given print
file and takes a code conversion according to the following table:
	
	ISO 646-IRV			IBM-PC CP437 (German)

	[	91 	05BH		Ä	142	08EH
	\	92 	05CH		Ö	153	099H
	]	93 	05DH		Ü	154	09AH
	{	123 	07BH		ä	132	084H
	|	124 	07CH		ö	148	094H
	}	125 	07DH		ü	129	081H
	~	126 	07EH		ß	225	0E1H

This allows the printing of german umlauts of wordstar text files using the 7
bit ascii charset of the german variant of ISO 646. All umlauts are converted to
their equivalent of the 8 bit IBM-PC OEM charset.


	Code data

In addition to file data, the program can send so-called Code data to the print
server. The main purpose of Code data is to send control or non-printing
characters to the print server easily.
Code data are entered byte by byte in the commandline directly. This can be 
done in front of, between or after file data.
There are three different input options to send Code data to the printer, which
are described below.

	Control character:
	
A control character is a text description consisting of two or more letters. The
text in column "code" must be entered, the decimal value is sent.

	code	decimal    description
		value

	NUL	0	   Null character
	SOH	1	   Start of heading
	STX	2	   Start of text
	ETX	3	   End of text
	EOT	4	   End of transmission
	ENQ	5	   Enquiry
	ACK	6	   Acknowledgment
	BEL	7	   Audible bell
	BS	8	   Backspace
	HT	9	   Horizontal tab
	LF	10	   Line feed
	VT	11	   Vertical tab
	FF	12	   Form feed
	CR	13	   Carriage return
	SO	14	   Shift out
	SI	15	   Shift in
	DLE	16	   Data link escape
	DC1	17	   Device control 1
	DC2	18	   Device control 2
	DC3	19	   Device control 3
	DC4	20	   Device control 4
	NAK	21	   Negative acknowledgment
	SYN	22	   Synchronous idle
	ETB	23	   End of transmission block
	CAN	24	   Cancel
	EM	25	   End of medium
	SUB	26	   Substitute character
	ESC	27	   Escape
	FS	28	   File separator
	GS	29	   Group separator
	RS	30	   Record separator
	US	31	   Unit separator
	SP	32	   White space
	DEL	127	   Delete

	ASCII character:

These are all printable ASCII signs, which can be entered as one letter in the
CP/M commandline directly. A letter will cause the sending of the corresponding
code in column decimal value.

	code		decimal value

	! to `		33 to 96
	{ to ~		123 to 126

Because CP/M converts all entered lowercase letters to uppercase letters in the 
commandline you cannot send the corresponding values. To send a value of a
lowercase letter enter the corresponding decimal code 97-122 directly.

	Decimal code:

A decimal code must always be entered with at least 2 digits! An entered Decimal
code is sent unchanged to the printer.
With the help of a Decimal code it is possible to send a lowercase letter value
from the CP/M commandline, see also ASCII character. 


	Print servers

A print server, or printer server, is a network device that connects printers to
client computers over a network. It accepts print jobs sent from the client
computers and sends the data to the attached printer(s).

Print servers may support a variety of industry-standard or proprietary printing
protocols like Internet Printing Protocol, Line Printer Daemon protocol, CUPS,
SMB or CIFS protocol.

NPRINT requires a print server, which supports the proprietary Jetdirect or
direct socket printing protocol. All other network printing protocols are not
supported.

A print server can be provided by software, hardware or a combination of both.
Some common variants of print servers are described briefly below.

	internal

A printer may have a built-in print server. The known HP JetDirect card is an
optional printer accessory, that allows a printer to be accessed through a
network, rather than via a direct connection. Printers with network port are 
similar solutions for internal print servers.

	external

Alternatively a print server may be a dedicated device in a separate housing on
the network with connections to the LAN and one or more printers. 
The most famous examples are HP JetDirect external print servers, which connect
printers to the network by adapting the printer’s parallel port to a network
port. Depending on the model, HP JetDirect external print servers can connect
up to three printers to a network.
Today external print servers from many different manufacturers are available.
There are models with wired or wireless network connection and for the
connection of printers with serial, parallel or USB interface.

	router

A Jetdirect print server can be implemented by additional software in routers
for home networks. The printer is attached to the router mostly at an USB port
of the router. The router software listens on port 9100 and passes everything it
receives to the USB printer.

	software

A print server may be a networked computer with one or more shared printers. A
suitable Jetdirect print server in software can be found at:
   https://sourceforge.net/projects/rawprintserver/
With this software you can print to installed windows printers per Jetdirect
protocol. It works only with existing, not with redirected virtual printers.


	NPRINT application example

The NPRINT computer is online in an ordinary home network. 

There is a network printer "Epson Stylus SX510W" available, which is connected
with the network by WLAN. The "Epson Stylus SX510W" implements a JetDirect print
server, which listens on port 9100 for printjobs.

This WLAN network printer has the IP 192.168.0.100 and the DNS-Name "SX".

The network printer is compatible with the printer language ESC/P, which was set
for the printer during the installation of wordstar.

The german wordstar file EP4041CP.TXT is printed with the print command of
Wordstar 3. After answering the second query with "Yes" the name EP4041CP.PRN is
entered and this print file is written to disc.

Subsequently, the PRN-file will be printed with the following command on the
network printer "Epson Stylus SX510W": 

NPRINT -rg SX EP4041CP.PRN FF

Explanation of parameters:

          -r  -  resets bit 7 of all wordstar file data
          -g  -  converts german printer file data to the IBM-PC OEM charset,
                 which is used by the network printer in text mode
          SX  -  the DNS-name of the printer in the home network
EP4041CP.PRN  -  printer file data
          FF  -  control character for "Form feed" after printing file data

Alternative command without DNS in the home network:

NPRINT -rg 192.168.0.100 EP4041CP.PRN FF
