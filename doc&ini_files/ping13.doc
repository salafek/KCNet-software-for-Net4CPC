	Description

PING.COM uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram to elicit an 
ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway.

ECHO_REQUEST datagrams or "Ping's" have an IP and ICMP header, followed by an 
arbitrary number of 'pad'-bytes, used to fill out the packet.


	Usage	
		
ping [-h|v] [-anq] [-c:count] [-i:interval] [-p:pattern]
 [-s:packet-size] [-t:ttl] [-u:tos] [-w:timeout] destination

Parameter (optional):

-h|v            Show help or version and exit

-a		Audible ping
-n		Numeric output only. No attempt will be made to lookup
		symbolic names for host addresses
-q		Quiet output. Nothing is displayed except the summary lines
		at startup time and when finished
 
-c:count	Stop after sending count ECHO_REQUEST packets.
-i:interval	Wait interval seconds between sending each packet. The 
		default is to wait for one second between each packet.
-p:pattern	You may specify up to 16 'pad'-bytes to fill out the packet
		you send. This is useful for diagnosing data-dependent problems
		in a network. For example, -p:ff will cause the sent packet to
		be filled with all ones.
-s:packetsize	Specifies the number of data bytes to be sent. The default is
		56, which translates into 64 ICMP data bytes when combined with
		the 8 bytes of ICMP header data. 
-t:ttl		Set the IP Time to Live. 
-u:tos		Set Quality of Service related bits in ICMP datagrams.
		Traditionally (RFC1349), these have been interpreted as:
		
		0 for reserved, currently being redefined as congestion control
		1-4 for Type of Service and 
		5-7 for Precedence.
		
		Possible settings for Type of Service are: 
		
		minimal cost: 0x02, 
		reliability: 0x04, 
		throughput: 0x08, 
		low delay: 0x10. 
		
		Multiple TOS bits should not be set simultaneously. Possible 
		settings for special Precedence range from:
		
		priority (0x20) to net control (0xe0).
		
		In RFC2474, these fields has been redefined as 8-bit 
		Differentiated Services (DS), consisting of: 
		
		bits 0-1 of separate data and 
		bits 2-7 of Differentiated Services Codepoint (DSCP).
		
-w:timeout	Time to wait for a response, in seconds.

Parameter (mandantory):

destination     Domain-Name or IP address of the destination host or gateway


	Instructions

When using ping for fault isolation, it should first be run on a common host
in the same network, to verify that the local network interface is up and
running. 

Then, hosts and gateways further and further away should be 'pinged'. Answer
times and packet loss statistics are computed. If duplicate packets are
received, they are not included in the packet loss calculation.

When the specified number of packets have been sent (and received) or if the
program is terminated with >ESC< / CTRL-C, a brief summary is displayed. 

The current statistics can be obtained without termination of process with 
the Key >ENTER<.


	Duplicate and Damaged Packets

Ping will report damaged packets. Damaged packets are obviously serious cause
for alarm and often indicate broken hardware somewhere in the ping packet's 
path (in the network or in the hosts).


	Trying Different Data Patterns

The (inter)network layer should never treat packets differently depending on 
the data contained in the data portion. Unfortunately, data-dependent problems 
have been known to sneak into networks and remain undetected for long periods 
of time. In many cases the particular pattern that will have problems is 
something that doesn't have sufficient 'transitions', such as all ones or all 
zeros, or a pattern right at the edge, such as almost all zeros. It isn't 
necessarily enough to specify a data pattern of all zeros (for example) on the 
command line because the pattern that is of interest is at the data link level, 
and the relationship between what you type and what the controllers transmit 
can be complicated.

This means that if you have a data-dependent problem you will probably have to 
do a lot of testing to find it. If you are lucky, you may manage to find a file,
that either can't be sent across your network or that takes much longer to 
transfer than other similar length files. You can then examine this file for 
repeated patterns, that you can test using the '-p' option of Ping.


	TTL Details

The TTL value of an IP packet represents the maximum number of IP routers, that 
the packet can go through before being thrown away. In current practice you can 
expect each router in the Internet to decrement the TTL field by exactly one.

The TCP/IP specification states that the TTL field for TCP packets should be 
set to 60, but many systems use smaller values (4.3 BSD uses 30, 4.2 used 15).

The maximum possible value of this field is 255, and most Unix systems set the 
TTL field of ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to 255. This is, why you will find you 
can 'Ping' some hosts, but not reach them with Telnet or FTP.
