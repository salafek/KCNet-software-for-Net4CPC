The Net4CPC Ethernet interface is equipped with the W5100S controller.
This controller doesn't provide a MAC Address.
The first time you run NCFG it will generate a MAC address in the form DE:AD:BE:EF:xx:xx where xx:xx are two random bytes. 
The generated MAC Address will then be saved in the file MACADDR.INI in plain text.
You can edit the MACADDR.INI file shoud you need to change the interface's MAC Address.
